# zcomp

According to the vector engine, here implement a system to estimate the vector capability on DL application
This citation is based on the sniper simulator, please download the sniper simulator and run the test on the sniper


## How to run
1. Copy the directory you want to test in to the sniper's test directory
2. Modify the Makefile to be compatible to the sniper (Reference the other makefile)
3. `make run`
